## About

This tool works an LLM model to interpret the Git diff and generate a commit message. There are two options then:

- This can be run using a local LLM server, at a no cost.
- If you have a paid subscription for ChatGPT, you can use configure against your credentials instead.

### Alternatives

If you want this logic as an extension is VS Code instead of CLI, you can search the extensions marketplace for extensions that generate commit messages as there are a lot, though they tend to require a ChatGPT token and paid subscription.
